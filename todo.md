# DONE:
- handle special exit statuses { check exec_cmd.c}: Status handled and tested.
- rename env.c ?: changed to print_env.c

# UNDER PROCESS:
- handle printing env like normal sh { check exec_cmd.c}
> I edited the function ... but still something is missing.

# NOT DONE YET:
- fix find_paths { check path_functions.c}
